"This code trains a model for speaker recognition using audio files. It begins by loading audio files from specified folders, extracting MFCC features (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) for each audio file. Then, it encodes the speaker labels and trains an SVC (Support Vector Classification) model on these features. The program then records audio from the microphone and analyzes the input audio to identify the speaker using the trained model. If the speaker is recognized, the speaker's name will be printed."
